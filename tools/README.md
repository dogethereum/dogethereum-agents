## JSON-RPC query examples

These scripts show how a query can be done. Superblocks can be queried as shown in the [first script](test-good-query.sh) using a named parameter for the superblock id or they can be queried using a parameter list as shown in the [second script](test-good-query-2.sh).

In short, the method should be `getSuperblock` and it should receive a single parameter: the superblock id.
